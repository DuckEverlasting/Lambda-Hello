Hello! My name is Matt Klein. Some words to describe me: friendly, nerdy, parent.

I have a great many hobbies, but one that floats to the top of my mind is a new one I've picked up in the last couple of months: gardening. We (my family and I) just moved into a new house, and we have a garden for the first time. I've been spending more time out there than I would have ever guessed. I find it very soothing. Perhaps this is a benefit of this "being outdoors" thing I keep hearing about.

ADDENDUM: I would like extra credit. Must keep up my GPA!
